# 🎮 Game App (Internship Project)

This repository contains my **first internship project**, built step-by-step with a strong focus on **real-world architecture**, not just code.

The goal of this project is to design and develop a **scalable game-based web application** using modern technologies like **React, Django, PostgreSQL, and cloud services**.

---

## 🧠 Why this project?

Instead of building random mini-projects, this application is designed to:

- Combine **frontend + backend + database**
- Use **industry-standard authentication**
- Follow **proper Git & deployment practices**
- Be scalable for future features

This project is divided into **phases**, just like real startup products.
